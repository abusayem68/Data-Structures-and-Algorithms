Introduction
------------

Data Structures and Algorithms are essential for organizing and processing data effectively. Data structures define ways to organize data, while algorithms provide step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Together, they enable us to create efficient and scalable solutions to complex problems.

Why Study DSA?
--------------

-   **Efficiency**: Optimized algorithms reduce time and resource usage.
-   **Problem-Solving**: Understanding DSA improves problem-solving skills.
-   **Foundational Knowledge**: Key in computer science, software development, and technical interviews.
-   **Performance**: Allows for the development of applications that handle large data with minimal latency.

Core Data Structures
--------------------

### Arrays

-   **Description**: Fixed-size, contiguous memory locations.
-   **Operations**: Access, insert, delete.
-   **Applications**: Used in systems where data size is known in advance.

### Linked Lists

-   **Description**: Sequential data structure where elements point to the next (or previous) element.
-   **Types**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
-   **Applications**: Ideal for dynamic memory allocation and lists with frequent insertions and deletions.

### Stacks and Queues

-   **Stack**: Last In, First Out (LIFO). Used for undo mechanisms, parsing expressions.
-   **Queue**: First In, First Out (FIFO). Used in scheduling, buffers.

### Trees

-   **Binary Trees**: Each node has up to two children.
-   **Binary Search Trees**: Binary tree with ordered nodes for efficient searching.
-   **Applications**: Databases, indexing, hierarchical data management.

### Graphs

-   **Description**: Consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
-   **Types**: Directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted.
-   **Applications**: Social networks, pathfinding, web crawling.

### Hash Tables

-   **Description**: Key-value pairs with efficient data retrieval based on unique keys.
-   **Applications**: Caching, databases, associative arrays.

Core Algorithms
---------------

### Searching Algorithms

-   **Linear Search**: Simple but less efficient, O(n)O(n)O(n).
-   **Binary Search**: Efficient on sorted data, O(log⁡n)O(\log n)O(logn).

### Sorting Algorithms

-   **Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort**: Basic algorithms, O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) in average cases.
-   **Quick Sort, Merge Sort**: Efficient, commonly used algorithms, O(nlog⁡n)O(n \log n)O(nlogn) in average cases.

### Graph Algorithms

-   **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traverses nodes by going deep before exploring breadth.
-   **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traverses nodes by exploring breadth before depth.
-   **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs.
-   **A* Algorithm**: Pathfinding algorithm using heuristics for faster searches.

### Dynamic Programming

-   **Description**: Optimization technique by breaking problems into overlapping subproblems.
-   **Applications**: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, optimal pathfinding.

Complexity Analysis
-------------------

Understanding complexity is essential for assessing an algorithm's performance in terms of time and space.

### Time Complexity

Describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size.

-   **Big O Notation**: Represents the upper bound of time complexity.
    -   **O(1)**: Constant time, independent of input size.
    -   **O(log⁡n\log nlogn)**: Logarithmic time, reduces operations with each step.
    -   **O(n)**: Linear time, directly proportional to input size.
    -   **O(n \log n)**: Log-linear, common in efficient sorting algorithms.
    -   **O(n^2), O(2^n)**: Quadratic and exponential times, representing slower, resource-intensive algorithms.

### Space Complexity

Describes the memory consumption of an algorithm based on input size. Generally represented by Big O notation, indicating how much auxiliary space an algorithm needs.
